# Energy-Harvesting system
thermoelectric charger and wearable device

## What is thermoeletric? 

#### How we energy harvesting them?
We have to find the maximum power point tracking. We need figure out the summit of IV curve in thermoelectric device so that we can have optimal load to obtain maximum from this device.

Therefore, we have to choose the proper PMIC and MCU to implement energy-harvesting system.

We may harvest energy from wasted heat, display energy-harvesting present information on OLED, and charge phones for emergency.

We can energy-harvest temperature difference between humans' skin and environment, and power consumption of transmission is only 10dbm to transmit receiver energy-harvesting information.
